# Air Quality Monitoring System: Testing Documentation

## Overview of Testing Strategy
This document outlines the testing approach used for the Air Quality Monitoring System based on Arduino Uno R4 WiFi. Our testing strategy involved a multi-layered approach from component-level testing to full system integration testing.

## Component-Level Testing

### Sensor Testing

#### BME280 Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure Sensor
- **Functionality tests**: Validated sensor initialization and basic reading functions
- **Stress tests**: Evaluated performance under high reading frequency

#### ENS160 Air Quality Sensor
- **Initialization tests**: Verified proper I2C communication and setup
- **Compensation verification**: Tested temperature and humidity compensation effects
- **Response tests**: Measured response time to changing air conditions

#### SPS30 Particulate Matter Sensor
- **Startup sequence tests**: Verified proper initialization
- **Measurement consistency**: Evaluated reading stability over time
- **Error handling**: Tested recovery from communication interruptions

### WiFi Connectivity Testing
- **Connection tests**: Verified successful connection to various WiFi networks

## Integration Testing

### Sensor Data Processing
- **Sensor fusion tests**: Verified proper integration of multiple sensor data
- **Data consistency**: Checked for anomalies when all sensors operate simultaneously
- **I2C bus load**: Tested for communication conflicts between sensors

### Data Transmission
- **JSON formatting**: Validated proper JSON structure generation
- **Payload size**: Measured data packet sizes under various conditions
- **Transmission reliability**: Tested success rate of data transmissions
- **Server response handling**: Verified proper handling of different HTTP response codes

## System Testing

### Environmental Testing
- **Dust exposure**: Tested particulate sensing in controlled dusty environments


### Long-Term Reliability
- **Data consistency**: Analyzed long-term data for drift or sensor degradation

## User Interface Testing
- **Serial output**: Verified readability and usefulness of serial monitor output
- **Error messaging**: Confirmed clear communication of error states

## Security Testing
- **Credentials storage**: Verified secure handling of WiFi credentials
- **Data transmission**: Tested HTTPS implementation and certificate validation
- **Input validation**: Checked handling of malformed server responses

## Continuous Integration
- **Version control integration**: Maintained test results alongside code commits
- **Regression testing**: Verified new features didn't break existing functionality

## Field Testing
- **Real-world deployment**: Tested device in actual indoor environments

## Test Results Summary
The Air Quality Monitoring System passed all critical test requirements, with minor issues identified in WiFi reconnection reliability and power optimization. The system demonstrated robust sensor data collection and reliable data transmission under normal operating conditions.

## Future Test Improvements
1. Automated regression test suite development
2. Environmental chamber testing for extreme conditions
3. Battery lifetime testing for portable deployments
4. Load testing with multiple devices sending data simultaneously
5. Penetration testing of the data transmission security
