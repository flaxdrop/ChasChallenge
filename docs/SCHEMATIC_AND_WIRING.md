# Circuit Diagram and Physical Wiring

## Introduction

This document contains the circuit diagram and how to physically wire the various components to create a functioning product.

## Circuit Diagram

### Quick Overview

The different colors in the wiring diagram represent different properties and what they connect to:
- **Red:** VCC  
- **Black:** GND  
- **Green:** Digital pins  
- **Purple:** SCL  
- **Brown:** SDA

## Physical Wiring

*Note: The SPS30 shown in this image is a mock-up used only for demonstrating the wiring.*

You can find the `.fzz` file for the project in [IoT/Fritzing](../IoT/Fritzing/) if you want to take a closer look.

*Note: Since the SPS30 component is a mock-up, it includes a few logical connections that are not intended to exist. Just ignore the airwires present in the `.fzz` file.*
